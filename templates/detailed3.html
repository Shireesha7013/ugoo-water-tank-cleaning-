    <h2>Detailed Cleaning Process</h2>
    <p>
      Cleaning large tanks requires specialized equipment and experienced staff. We begin with a detailed inspection to locate sediment, algae, or microbial contamination. Using industrial-grade brushes and high-pressure jets, we clean the tank walls, floor, and corners thoroughly. All sludge and sediment are removed and safely disposed of according to environmental guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the physical cleaning is complete, we apply approved disinfectants to ensure complete removal of bacteria, viruses, and harmful microorganisms. The disinfectant is left for the appropriate duration, after which the tank is rinsed completely. A water quality check is performed to confirm safety for consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inlet and outlet pipes are inspected and cleaned to prevent blockages and maintain optimal water flow. Filters are cleaned or replaced as necessary. Our team also provides detailed advice on preventive measures, such as cleaning frequency and avoiding contamination sources. This ensures long-term water hygiene and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service is designed for households with large water requirements or small commercial facilities. By combining professional cleaning, disinfection, and maintenance consultation, we provide a comprehensive solution that protects both health and infrastructure.
